# TanksDemo
This is a demo of a 3D Tank Battle game with Single and Multiplayer Modes.

## Description
I created this project to get familiar with Unity's Networking system. During the process I thought it would also be fun to create an endless single player mode. 


## What I Learned
* Networking Using uNet
* How to debug a Networking project
* Working with network sync/lag issues

## Design Patterns Used
* Singleton
* Component
* Generic Object
* Interface
